4 Question 
Answer - The <tag> tag is used to define a group of tags that are going to be placed inside a parent tag. The <tag> element can be used to define the element or an additional text or an image that is going to be rendered on the page.

Ex - 

a - <!DOCTYPE html>

This is the tag that tells the browser what kind of HTML we're looking at. This is how the browser knows how to interpret all of the content it receives.

b - <html>

This element is the top container for everything else in your document. It includes any other elements that might be inside of it, but it doesn't include anything else on its own.

c - <body>

This element contains all of your content, including images, videos, and other media files you want to include in your document.

d - <header>

You can put any HTML inside this element, but only if it's not a descendant of <body>. You can also put form controls there as wellâ€”but don't put any code in there by itself.


5 Question
Answer - The DOCTYPE declaration is a line of code that tells the web browser what type of markup to expect when you format your page.

The DOCTYPE declaration is placed in the <head> of your HTML document. It defines a standard set of markup that all browsers should follow and understand, which allows for more consistent code across many pages.

In order for an element to be recognized by a browser, it needs to have a particular set of tags and attributes (called "names") attached to it. The DOCTYPE declaration specifies these names and other properties that can be used in future documents, making them easy for browsers to recognize.
